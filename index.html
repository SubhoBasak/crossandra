            Crossandra is a closed source, free to use <i class="highlight">(commercially & personally)</i> compiled
            style langauge, that
            helps
            you to style your web app fast and easily. It's also helps you to add dark theme and responsiveness to your
            design with minimum effort. The crossandra compiler use many iteration of checking to find the bugs as well
            as
            scope of optimization. It use <i class="highlight">virtual box property</i> to find out the ultimate out
            come and then suggest you
            the optimization options what will result the same output with minimum cost.

                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Keyword checking</h3>
                <p>During the compile time it will check if all the keyword lies inside the source code are valid or
                    not.<br /><br />For example, you write 'my-custom-property' in any style block. That will show an
                    error that
                    'my-custom-property' is not a valid keyword.<br /><br /> Thus your code will be completely
                    <strong>dead code
                        free</strong> unlike
                    css.

            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Duplicate property checking</h3>
                <p>This will also check if you write same property for the same element multiple time or
                    not.<br /><br />For example, you write 'min-w-50' two or tree or 'N' number of times. Then the
                    compiler will give an error that you wrote 'min-w-50' for N times.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Duplicate state checking</h3>
                <p>If you use same set of properties for multiple states it will give you error to remove the low
                    priority state.<br /><br />For example you wrote 'color-primary' & 'border-primary-dark' for the
                    default state and on hover state you also wrote the same properties, 'color-primary' &
                    'border-primary-dark'.<br /><br />So ultimately the hover state became useless for this case, that's
                    why compiler will ask you to remove it.
                </p>

            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Duplicate block checking</h3>
                <p>If you write exact same block with different name for multiple time, then the compiler will ask you
                    to merge them as one to minimize the code size.<br /><br />For example, you write a block #myButton
                    with 'm-1', 'p-2', 'round-3' & 'delay-1' as default property and 'move-up-1' as hover state
                    property. Unknowingly you write the same set of properties for another block
                    #PrimaryButton.<br /><br />If two blocks contain same properties then there is no meaning to keep
                    both of them and increase the size and reduce the performence.

            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Conflict checking</h3>
                <p>The crossandra compiler will give an error if you write different variant of same property that are
                    conflicting with each other.<br /><br />Like, you write 'w-50' & 'w-75' for the same element at same
                    state.<br /><br />The compiler will give you the error. Now you can decide what to do.

            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Value optimization</h3>
                <p>To optimize the ultimate CSS, crossandra compiler will use the virtual box property of CSS to
                    generate the current outcome and recommend the optimum way to get the exact same
                    outcome.<br /><br />
                    For example, you write 'mt-3', 'mb-3', 'ml-2', 'mr-2'. As you can guess, the compiler will suggest
                    you to use only 'my-3' & 'mx-2' instead.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Property scope limitation</h3>
                <p>To keep your design consisten crossandra compiler limit the scope of each property. Let's understand
                    it with an example:<br /><br />
                    You can set the default color of a button as 'color-primary' and in hover state
                    'color-primary-dark'. But you can not change the color in media query states (sm, md, lg, xl).
                    Ultimately your button color will be same for each screen size, but can be different for other
                    states.<br /><br />
                    By the same way you can only change the margin, padding and all the sizing related properties only
                    in media query states (sm, md, lg, xl). You cannot change margin on hover or focus or dark state.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Identifier name checking</h3>
                <p>Long chaining in CSS is very expensive and future update may easily break your design. Like, .navbar
                    .navbar-brand .navbar-brand-img img {...}<br /><br />
                    To solve this problem crossandra restricted the chaining and use unique identifiers. It allow only
                    two kind of identifiers, ID based & class based.<br /><br />
                    There is also naming constrains, each Identifier name can contain only [a-zA-Z0-9] and first letter
                    must be [a-zA-Z]. Ultimately it force you to use <strong>Camel Case</strong> or <strong>Pascal
                        Case</strong>. Because these can hold same value in more compact way. For example, ProfileImage
                    is 12 characters long, but profile_image (Snake Case) is 13 characters long.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="oviewHdr">Under the hood</h2>
        <div class="oviewContainer">
            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Common state merging</h3>
                <p>If two or more blocks container all same states and properties then compiler will ask you to merge
                    them. But if multiple blocks contain only few numbers of common states, then during the output
                    generation the compiler will automatically merge them by maintaining the same output.<br /><br />For
                    example, #CardA contain 'm-3', 'round-3', 'p-2' as default properties & 'w-50' for media query
                    state sm. On the other hand #CardB also contain 'm-3', 'round-3', 'p-2' as default properties and
                    don't contain any media query state, or suppose contain media query state with some different value,
                    'w-25'. In both case both of the blocks are different, just the default properties are same. So the
                    compiler will internally merge them like that:<br /><br />
                    #CardA, #CardB { m-3, round-3, p-2 }<br /><br />
                    MediaQuery(SM){<br />
                    #CardA{ w-50 }<br />
                    #CardB{ w-25 }<br />
                    }
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="oviewDiv">
                <h3 class="oviewDivHdr">Shorthand syntax</h3>
                <p>Crossandra use shorthand CSS syntax to minimize the code size by maintaining the exact same
                    output.<br /><br />For example, you write mt-3 mb-2 ml-1 mr-4, it will generate CSS like that-
                    margin: 3unit 4unit 2unit 1unit;<br /><br />
                    Crossandra only accepts 6digit hex code for colors, that's give it ability to replace the color code
                    with shorthand syntax if possible.<br /><br />
                    For example, you set primary color as #1188ff. During CSS generation, it will replace the hex code
                    with #18f and for the alpha channel, if the color contain #1188ff33, then it will replace it with
                    #18f3.
